Each node has two threads:
	1)
		every 10ms, send self info out to all neighbors
			each node knows which ports represent its neighbors
			broadcast pkt on each neighbor port in turn
			for each neighbor in neighbors
				if neighbor is too far, remove from neighbor list, and do not broadcast
				otherwise, broadcast self data packet and any queued to-be-forwarded packets
			after broadcast, check if neighbors are still neighbors (within range)
				if not, remove
		update its own x, v, and a after each broadcast (~10ms)
			uses real time, not timesteps
	2)
		continuously listens for broadcasts on own port
			only other nodes broadcast on this node's port
			whenever a truck data packet is received:
				check most recent forward table
					maps node id to highest packet seqNum that has been received with a source == node id
					if current packet has already been received/forwarded, do not update cache or forward
					if this seqNum is the highest seqNum for node id, then do next steps and add this packet to forwarding queue
				update corresponding truck cache entry
					check distance, if close, add neighbor
				add immediate sender to neighbor list, if not already neighbor
