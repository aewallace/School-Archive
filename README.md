_Welcome to my school project archive!_

If you’re here, you’ve probably stumbled onto my work through random searches. Or maybe you’re here for a specific reason that is somewhat unknown…to me, at least.

Anyway, as I said, welcome! This contains >80% of all the code I wrote while at Auburn University, across many projects/homework assignments, across multiple languages. 

\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

What languages might one find in this archive? Some **Python, C++, OpenGL, Objective C, Java… Even VHDL to simulate a processor!** The list is by far not exhaustive, but those are the primary languages (or libraries) used.

Oh, and Japanese. There's one project that made use of a little Japanese.

There’s a lot of cruft still in place, including the assignment details and temporary files; maybe that will give you an idea of how my approach to tasks changed over the 3 years (7 semesters, including a summer semester) I was at Auburn.

I’m proud of my work, and I’m proud that most of my stuff is commented. If you ever get the urge to ask a question, feel free! Contact information is available on Github itself, or may be shown in the comments of select projects with my email address. Github comments are cool, too.

May the odds forever be in your favor! Too dramatic? Okay, sorry.

Each semester has its own folder, with whatever relevant information/files I could find intact. Z is the oldest, T is the newest, but you can tell because each is labeled with the semester (spring/summer/fall) and the year.

Of note is the senior design from the last semester (Spring 2014), which was the most massive collaboration I’d done. It was a semester long project with 5 people, and was actually quite fun. The code we did together should be in use today and is probably being iterated upon this very second. Many other bits of homework/projects were with at least one partner, though you can probably tell that a not-insignificant bit is of my own work. That’s just a warning, in case you run across any names that sound unfamiliar.

Take care!
